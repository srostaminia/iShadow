This folder contains utility scripts for working with the iShadow platform, separated out by hardware revision. Most of the scripts are for reading data from the glasses in some form, there is (should be) an index in each folder briefly describing all of the scripts.

Current folders:

- misc: Contains some scripts that were used in firmware development but are not needed for day-to-day operation of the glasses

- rev0-legact: The rev0 prototypes were our initial proof-of-concept and we broke out the code bases very differently for these platforms than we do now for the Cortex-based hardware. This is poorly documented, and because it is legacy at this point it will probably be left that way.

- rev3: Scripts for interfacing with the current version of the glasses. Probably everything you want is in here.
