\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

In this work, we have laid out the design space for low-power wireless vision enabled systems.  We have argued that now is the time for such etcetcetc.

We have demonstrated this with our proof of concept, the InSight wireless gaze tracking glasses.  Our glasses are capable of coarsely tracking the wearer's gaze with startling accuracy.
